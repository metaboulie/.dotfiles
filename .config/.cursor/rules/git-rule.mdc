# Git rule

For every answer (modification, iteration, etc.), you should run `git add` on
files you modified and then run `git commit` with a drafted message to commit
them.

NEVER use other git commands.

Here is the template of commit:

``` <type>[scope]: <description>

[body]

[optional footer(s)] ```

- **Type**: One of `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`,
  `perf`, `ci`, `build`, `revert`.
- **Scope**: Indicates the section of the codebase.
- **Description**: Short summary, imperative mood, max 50 characters.
- **Body**: Detailed explanation, wrapped at 72 characters.
- **Footer**: Metadata such as issue references.
